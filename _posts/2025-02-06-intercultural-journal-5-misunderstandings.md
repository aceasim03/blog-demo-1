There’s a Conflict.

As a foreigner in China, I naturally face challenges with the language. I’m not trying my absolute hardest all the time, but I am putting in real effort.

What baffles me, though, is a behavior I run into sometimes: when I say I don’t understand something in Chinese, the response is often to repeat the same phrase, in the same way, and in the same language.

In an interaction, I usually default to Chinese—it’s the logical thing to do while living here. But when I don’t understand someone’s request, command, or instructions after one or two attempts, I’ll say “不好意思，我听不懂” or “Sorry, I don’t understand,” and I try to make it obvious through tone, gestures, and expression that I’m struggling.

Typically, when someone realizes they’re not being understood, the next step is to adapt: use gestures, simpler phrasing, or a translation app. In my experience, gestures alone often get the job done.

What I struggle with is when the response is just to repeat the same words, only louder or faster. And when that inevitably still doesn’t work, frustration sets in. It’s hard not to feel that frustration is misplaced when the approach isn’t changing even though it clearly isn’t working.

To be clear: I’m not saying this is some “Chinese” thing, or that it’s cultural. It happens in lots of places. Most people don’t mean any harm. Maybe it’s a lack of awareness, or nerves, or just habit. Still, it’s tough to deal with when you’re visibly trying.

We ought to recognize that immigrants or foreigners navigating a new language may need extra patience and alternative ways of communication to complete the same tasks. That’s part of assimilation, and it takes time. And yes, I take responsibility for choosing to live here—it’s on me to learn the language and adapt.

But communication is a two‑way street. I’m working to improve my Chinese, but collaboration matters. Let’s solve problems together, not make people feel excluded or inadequate for not yet mastering a language that is, for many learners, genuinely difficult.

One Last Note—

This may not be directly related, but it feels connected.

Over my years speaking English, Urdu, Punjabi, Hindi, German, and now Chinese, I’ve noticed something troubling: language is often used as a tool of exclusion rather than inclusion. Something meant to connect us can become a quiet way to divide.

That kind of behavior is not just hurtful—it feels like hiding behind language instead of engaging honestly with the person in front of you.

I remember taking my dad out for a meal, just to enjoy some time together. As we sat there, I overheard people talking about us—especially about him. Some of it was positive, but the negative comments cut through.

I got up and, calmly and with a smile, asked them to stop, explaining that I understood what they were saying. They looked shocked and apologized, as if it had never occurred to them that I might understand. But why was that surprising? I had spoken to them in Chinese moments before.

It wasn’t just the assumption that I wouldn’t understand; it was the disrespect of speaking about us like that in a language they already knew I could follow.

All we wanted was to enjoy their food and the time we had together. Instead, their words turned what could’ve been a simple, joyful moment into an exercise in restraint.

And that’s the strange burden that moments like this hand you: to rise above it, to resist generalizing everyone, and to salvage what you can from an experience that didn’t need to be painful. A little basic kindness would have gone a long way.

My dad still had a great time, though, because he just cared about the food. I hope I can move more in that direction too—just eat, ignore the nonsense, and leave the pettiness at the door. After all, the food was really good. Maybe that’s the secret to surviving here: focus on the food, and let the rest fade into the background.
