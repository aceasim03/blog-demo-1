Given that this is the first journal entry, I find it important to give some context on my identity. This will better inform the reader of my thoughts and perspectives.

I grew up a son of Pakistani immigrants in the US. I’m from New Jersey, and I love everything about it there; we have four seasons, good food, beaches, mountains, and valleys. I also love being Pakistani; our food is amazing, we strive to treat everybody like family, and we love to dance and sing and bring smiles to people’s faces. My childhood and life thus far have been a combination of all these qualities. That being said, the intersection of both my cultures has not always been glamorous, but it is my identity and I carry it with me wherever I go. That place is currently China.

The interesting thing about China to me is that it is a combination of two countries I have lived in: Pakistan and Japan.




I will explain, but before I do, it is important to note that this comes from my experiences living in Pakistan’s rural villages and big cities like Karachi and Lahore. When it comes to my experiences in Japan, I have lived in Tokyo and in Takasaki, Gunma, quite like Kunshan in size. My sample size and duration aren’t large, but I am making some generalizations.

Pakistan has crowded streets, pollution, smokers, street food, I get stared at a lot, and there are many smells and sights, not all desirable.

Japan has architecture similar to Chinese architecture, there’s a similar appreciation for calligraphy, a lot of tea houses, a big emphasis on trash and recycling, smokers, crowded streets, and I still get many stares. I wonder why…




China is like a mix of the two. There are organized public spaces like in Japan accompanied by the sounds and smells of street food like in Pakistan. China has the chaos and crowdedness of Pakistan, but the order and organization of Japan. These two mix in an interesting way that I haven’t yet been able to articulate clearly but hope to by the end of this course.




All this said, I am always trying to find the connections between these three places, and the US, my home. Why? That’s how I can understand and appreciate different cultures more effectively. My experience in leading cross-cultural endeavors such as DKU’s Music Night or the English Corner at my Chinese law firm internship has led me to understand that to bring together groups of different people, similarities must dominate the conversation. We must focus and emphasize our similarities so much that the differences seem like nuances and cool additions to the game. If we focus too much on differences, we will remain divided. However, if we focus on similarities, it is easier to become more empathetic and to see the other person as a fellow human being, not a random person from a different culture and upbringing.




Focusing on the similarities helps me to appreciate the differences we have better. This is an optimal method for me, as it helps me to see differences as something more positive than negative. An example of this is from one of the videos from the homework about food from Suzhou. What stuck out to me was the omelet and pancake breakfast. This stuck out to me because this is very similar to my breakfast back home in the US. I like an omelet with the fluffiness and cheesiness of American omelets combined with the spices and vegetables of Pakistani omelets. I eat this hybrid omelet with paratha, which is Pakistani bread that is very similar in texture and ingredients to scallion pancakes.




When I eat breakfast here in China at DKU, I like to get myself an omelet with cheese and a scallion pancake. It reminds me of home, but it is an interesting feeling--I’m making a makeshift Pakistani-American breakfast with Chinese ingredients. In this case, the similarity of the omelet is there, but instead of adding some specific spices such as red chili powder, I see that they have soy sauce available for students. This is specific to China. With regards to the scallion pancakes, we have our paratha, but we don’t include scallions in there like that. These are small differences, especially compared to the big similarities, and it helps me to appreciate the soy sauce and scallion addition more. “This is how they enjoy it, maybe I can try it sometime and experience their taste more. After all, it must be delicious”




Food is a way to bring people together, and I care about food so dearly. I own a restaurant back home in the US, where we serve primarily Pakistani food with some other foods, such as Mexican and even Chinese food (coming soon). The goal is to be a halal food emporium, where those who eat halal food can enjoy freely the various dishes they normally wouldn’t be able to eat at other restaurants.

Because food is so important to cultures and connections, it becomes extremely important to take advantage of its power as such and to use it to emphasize similarities. My omelet also uses two eggs, and I also include the same vegetables, but I don’t cook it like that with chopsticks. I don’t use the same spices, but it still tastes amazing. The omelet reminds me of home, which makes me happy. Zoom in on how we’re similar, and it’ll make us remember the more positive memories, and bring us closer together.
