I was in Shanghai the other day and spent some time people‑watching. I was noticing how many people around me seemed at ease in their routines and environments. It reminded me of my time in Japan, where I also had the impression that a lot of people across different ages and backgrounds moved through daily life in a way that felt settled and familiar to them.

What I mean by “comfortable” here is feeling integrated into a system and society so that many everyday things are relatively frictionless. I’ve seen interviews asking people in Japan and China whether they’d like to move abroad, and I’ve also heard friends and acquaintances talk about this. Some express curiosity about going elsewhere, but also describe feeling deeply rooted where they are—partly because they anticipate the discomfort and uncertainty of starting over in a new place.

In these contexts, a lot of things appear to work quite smoothly for people who grew up there. When you’re raised in a relatively cohesive linguistic and cultural environment, many systems are designed with you in mind. In China, for instance, platforms like 美团, 淘宝, and 高德地图 are overwhelmingly tailored to local users. For someone who doesn’t speak the language or isn’t used to the interface conventions, these apps can feel like sensory overload. Once you do understand them, though, they can make daily life incredibly convenient: ordering a last‑minute bouquet on 美团, finding a specific type of gift on 淘宝, or planning a trip and booking transportation and a hotel through 高德地图.

That kind of comfort is much easier to access if you’ve grown up inside the ecosystem. As an international student or visitor, it can feel like you’re always one or two steps behind, never quite reaching the same level of ease. For me, that’s where a tension appears: the very systems that are so convenient for many locals can, unintentionally, make it harder for outsiders to feel fully included or to navigate life independently. I'm also not sure if it's their responsibility to burden themselves with either.

I’ve also noticed that this sense of comfort shows up in other parts of life, though my perspective is limited and shaped by who I spend time with. Outside of DKU, I’ve met some Chinese students whose choices and aspirations looked, to me, more settled—working part‑time in cafés, studying arts or other fields, and seeming fairly content with that trajectory. Among DKU Chinese students, I’ve seen a different energy, perhaps because they’re in a more international and unfamiliar environment, which naturally pushes people to adapt and stretch themselves. I recognize this is based on a small and very specific slice of people, and it doesn’t capture the full range of experiences or ambitions that exist.

All of this feeds into my own complicated relationship with “comfort.” On the one hand, I appreciate how comforting it can be when life feels straightforward and systems just work. On the other hand, I personally associate growth with periods of discomfort—times when I’m navigating a new culture, language, or institution and have to rethink my assumptions. My worry, for myself at least, is that staying too comfortable for too long can make it easier to stop questioning things or challenging myself.

I don’t think there’s a single right balance here. Some people find deep fulfillment in stability and familiarity; others are drawn to frequent change and disruption. I’m still trying to understand where I fall on that spectrum, and living and studying in places like China and Japan has made me think more critically about how comfort, homogeneity, and growth interact in my own life.
