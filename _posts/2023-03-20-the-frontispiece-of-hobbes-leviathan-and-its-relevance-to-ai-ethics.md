The frontispiece of Hobbes’ Leviathan is an intriguing image, to say the least. It depicts a giant figure composed of smaller human figures, holding a sword and a crosier. The figure is often interpreted as a representation of the state or the sovereign, as described in Hobbes' political philosophy.

The figure is made up of smaller human figures, suggesting that the sovereign's power comes from the people, who collectively make up the body. The sword and the crosier symbolize the two types of power wielded by the sovereign: the sword being the power of coercion and force, and the crosier being the power of religion and persuasion. Together, these two forms of power enable the sovereign to maintain order and stability in society.

The frontispiece is also related to Hobbes' egoistic philosophy. According to Hobbes, individuals are fundamentally motivated by self-interest and a desire to avoid harm. This leads to a state of nature in which life is "solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short" (Hobbes 1651, 77). To escape this state of nature, individuals must enter a social contract with one another, agreeing to give up some of their liberties in exchange for the protection and security provided by the state (Floridi 2016).

The frontispiece illustrates this idea by depicting the sovereign as a giant figure, representing the collective power of the people, who have given up some of their power to the sovereign to gain protection and security. The image also shows the people beneath the monarch, suggesting that they are subordinate to the state and that their interests must be subordinated for the greater good of society.

Concerning AI ethics, the frontispiece raises questions about the role of AI in society and the relationship between AI and individuals. Just as the sovereign in Hobbes' political philosophy holds power over individuals, AI systems may hold significant power and influence over human lives. This raises concerns about the potential impact of AI on individual rights, freedoms, and interests (Bostrom 2014).

Moreover, just as individuals in Hobbes' social contract theory must give up some of their liberties in exchange for the protection provided by the state, individuals in a society that includes AI may also need to give up some of their liberties in exchange for the benefits provided by AI systems. This requires careful consideration of the ethical implications of AI systems, including questions about how to balance individual interests and liberties with the greater good of society.

The frontispiece of Hobbes' Leviathan is a powerful image that conveys important philosophical ideas about egoism and social contract theory. It raises questions about the role of power and authority in society, and how individuals must balance their self-interest with the greater good of society. These questions are relevant to AI ethics, as we consider the ethical implications of AI systems and their impact on individual rights and freedoms.
