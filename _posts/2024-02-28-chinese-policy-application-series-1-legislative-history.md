Subject: Legislative History and Current Status of AI and Digital Policy in China

Date: February 28th, 2024

 

China’s rapid advancements in Artificial Intelligence have positioned China to be a global leader in its development and regulation. The government's strategy combines a proactive approach to AI development along with restrictive measures to ensure China’s national security and uphold social ethics. This memo provides a legislative history of AI regulation in China, the goal is to inform the Institute of Artificial Intelligence Ethical Cooperation (IAIEC)[2]’s advocacy for balanced AI regulation that encourages innovation and addresses ethical and security concerns.




# Legislative History

New Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan (2017) & 14th Five-Year Plan for National Informatization (2021-2025):

The issuance of the "New Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan" by China's State Council marked a pioneering moment in China’s AI ambitions, laying the groundwork for China’s plans to become a global leader by 2030, emphasizing innovation, regulation, and ethical norms. The plan marked China’s strategic pivot towards leveraging AI for national development and global competition (Webster et al. 2017). The 14th Five-Year Plan underscores China’s ambition to digitally transform the country, enhancing the digital infrastructure, data governance, and the integration of digital technologies across various sectors, such as education and criminal justice (Creemers et al. 2022). For years to come, this plan is and will be increasingly more pivotal in understanding the context and extent to which AI innovations are to be fostered in China.

Introduction of AI Regulations (2021-2024): The Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) has played a critical role in shaping the regulatory landscape for AI. Recent measures have focused on enhancing security assessments, establishing ethical standards, and ensuring transparency in AI algorithms, especially considering issues regarding its application in the criminal justice system (Yang 2023). Examples of these regulations from Latham & Watkins firm are the Algorithm Recommendation Regulation (2022), Deep Synthesis Regulation (2023), Generative AI Regulation (2023), and Draft Ethical Review Measure (2023). Special attention has been given to generative AI technologies, with regulations aimed at preventing the spread of misinformation and protecting intellectual property rights, considering the recent Beijing Internet Court Ruling (知产库 2023).




# Conclusion

China has made notable progress in structuring and proactively involving itself with AI, however, challenges persist, including concerns over innovation settlement, regulatory ambiguity, and the difficulty of balancing national security with global collaboration (European Union 2021, Art. 52). Future policies should continue to refine this delicate balance, simultaneously promoting ethical development and international cooperation. Enhanced dialogue between government, CAC, industries, academia, and the public is necessary to incorporate a wide range of perspectives, encourage innovation, and address emerging challenges and leverage opportunities in AI for the benefit of China. Thank you.
