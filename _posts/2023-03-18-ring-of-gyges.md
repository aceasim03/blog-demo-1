In Plato's "Ring of Gyges" from The Republic, a shepherd named Gyges finds a magical ring that makes him invisible. With this newfound power, Gyges can commit crimes without fear of being caught or punished (Plato 2013, 335-343). This story raises an important ethical question: if we can act immorally without getting caught, why should we still choose to be moral?

One possible answer to this question is that there are intrinsic reasons to be moral, beyond just egoistic concerns. Morality asks us to consider the interests and well-being of others, not just ourselves. By acting morally, we contribute to a more just and fair society, where everyone's rights and interests are respected. This, in turn, creates a better world for everyone, including ourselves.

Moreover, moral actions can also bring us personal satisfaction and a sense of purpose. For example, helping others can create a sense of fulfillment and happiness, even if it does not immediately benefit us. Acting morally can also create a sense of trust and respect from others, which can be valuable in personal and professional relationships.

However, if we assume that morality only serves our egoistic concerns, such as maintaining a good reputation or avoiding punishment, then the decision to act morally becomes more complicated. In this case, if we are reasonably sure we can get away with doing wrong, we might be tempted to act immorally.

But even if we have a super-computer that assures us that we can get away with it, there are still reasons to be moral. For example, if we value honesty, we might choose not to deceive others, even if we know we can get away with it. If we value fairness, we might choose not to exploit others, even if we know we can benefit from it.

The decision to be moral is not just about avoiding punishment or maintaining a good reputation. There are intrinsic reasons to act morally that go beyond egoistic concerns. By acting morally, we contribute to a better society and create a sense of personal satisfaction and purpose. While the temptation to act immorally may be strong, there are still reasons to choose morality, even if we are reasonably sure we can get away with doing wrong.

This story and its take on morality have two main overlaps with AI Ethics.

Firstly, as artificial intelligence systems become more advanced and complex, they are increasingly making decisions that affect human lives, such as in healthcare, criminal justice, and autonomous machines. In these contexts, AI systems must make moral decisions that align with our values and interests, even if it may not be in their immediate self-interest, whatever that may be. This raises the question of whether we can trust AI systems to act morally, and how we can ensure they are designed and programmed to act ethically in all situations, considering complicated emotions and circumstances (Bostrom and Yudkowsky 2014, 316-334.

Secondly, the development of AI raises questions about the potential impact on society, particularly regarding issues such as job displacement, bias, and privacy. These are ethical concerns that require us to consider the broader impact of AI on society, rather than just the narrow self-interest of AI developers and users (Floridi 2018, 457-470). This highlights the importance of considering the ethical implications of AI systems, even if they may not immediately benefit those who create or use them. What would directly benefit them?

In both contexts, the issue of why we should act morally, even if it may not be in our immediate self-interest, is relevant to AI ethics. Just as individuals must consider the intrinsic value of morality beyond egoistic concerns, AI systems must be designed to prioritize ethical considerations beyond narrow self-interests.
