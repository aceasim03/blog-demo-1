Welcome 👋  
This is my in-progress notebook on **AI ethics, art, and travel** — the three threads that shape how I think and move through the world.

You’ll find:

- 🧠 **AI & Ethics** – notes on research, readings, and debates
- 🎨 **Art & Imagination** – how creativity shapes (and resists) technology
- ✈️ **Fieldnotes & Travel** – being on the move while thinking about all of this

Posts are informal but grounded: I’ll cite people where relevant, link to papers, and also be honest about the emotional side of doing this work.
