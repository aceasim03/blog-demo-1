Lately I’ve been thinking about how **AI ethics conversations change when you’re physically in different cities** — Beijing vs. Shanghai vs. wherever I’m flying to next.

On paper, we talk about:

- governance frameworks  
- principles like transparency, accountability, fairness  
- papers by scholars like X, Y, Z

But on the ground, it often feels like:

- the way people move through subway stations under cameras  
- the quiet trade-off between convenience and visibility  
- how architecture, art, and public screens shape your mood  

### A small example

Here you can write a concrete story: a train station, an app check, a piece of public art, a billboard, etc. 

Then connect it back to **AI ethics**:  
How does this moment complicate “privacy,” “consent,” or “community”?
